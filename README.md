# gpu-collisions

A physics engine that does collision detection and calculates collision response using a mobil GPU with no general purpose computing API available. This was implemented on an iPhone 3GS. The code is written in c++ and OpenGL ES 2.0.

This is the code from my masters thesis that I did together with Johan Jungbeck. The actual thesis paper is also included here.
